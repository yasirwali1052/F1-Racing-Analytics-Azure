## Formula1 Overview
Formula 1 (F1) is the highest level of single-seater auto racing worldwide and is governed by the FIA. It showcases advanced and powerful cars equipped with hybrid engines. The F1 season occurs once a year and consists of races that take place over the course of a weekend, typically from Friday to Sunday. These races are held at various circuits in different countries. In each race, there are 10 teams, each with two assigned drivers.

The F1 season typically includes 20 to 23 races, also known as Grands Prix. Safety is a paramount concern, with strict regulations and ongoing technological advancements to ensure the well-being of drivers and spectators. Pit stops are a common occurrence during races, allowing teams to change tires and make adjustments to the cars.

On Saturdays, a qualifying round is held to determine the starting positions of drivers on the grid for the Sunday race. The races themselves consist of a variable number of laps, usually ranging from 50 to 70 laps, depending on the circuit's length. Pit stops are available during races for tire changes or car adjustments.

The results of each race are used to calculate driver standings and constructor standings. The driver who leads the driver standings at the end of the season is crowned the drivers' champion, while the team that leads the constructor standings becomes the constructors' champion
